# ResUNet-Enhancer
GAN for image translation or enhancement. 
The model consists of a ResUNet generator based on the paper [Road Extraction by Deep Residual U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10684), and multiple Patch-GAN discriminators based on the work [High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11585).
